Again, so far this project hasn't been too challenging, We had a few bugs to iron out for the movement (Scott is working on it), and I am working on the 
scoring mechanisms, and finished adding some pizzazz which was giving me a lot of trouble because the timings where tricky to figure out for updating the
board. Scott is working on the disjoint set portion, which shouldnt take long because it can be referenced easily from the superball lab. Currently the board
is bucket and pieces can fall and fit together but none go away yet (bc no scoring feature). We should be finished this week, and I met with my partner and 
he is fixing functonality for the keys and adding disjoint set logic.

MTG's Personal Log:
	02hr generating project proposal file (50% in lab)
	02hr familiarization with ncurses
	01hr Generating potential header files, supporting files, and main
	01hr Generating MTG's Update1.txt file
	01hr Generating MTG's Update2.txt file
	01hr Adding a file to hold all the defined pieces
	01hr Separating pieces into .c/.h file to make addreability easier
	03hr Adding a board that shows a piece falling and end game (parital Tetris functionality) (also kinda was temp)
	06hr Added 4 more hidden rows to the top of the board to give a scrolling inn effect
	02hr Figuring out colors in ncurses
	12hr Adding color changing and fixing the timing for the Tetris logo(bc moving the piece down was making the tetris run at differnt speeds), 
		fixing piece being a specific color and holding it
	02hr figuring out the best way to get my defined pieces to translate well with the Tetris board(might need alterations)
	05hr score board with nothing in it(not done)
