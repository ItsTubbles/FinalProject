We have almost completed the project now. There are just a few bugs left to iron out but I think we will definitely be ready for presentation day. Since the last update, I have worked on the slides presented 
in class as well as debugging the movement/rotation code. Currently, there exists 2 bugs that we are aware of. The first is that rotation of a piece that would cause the active piece to overlap with pieces
already on the board will delete the piece already on the board. Also, if you rotate a piece such that any part of that piece would go out of the left/right bounds, the section of the piece that would go out of bounds 
imprints on the other side of the board, placing it at that position.
