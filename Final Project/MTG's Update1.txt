So far this project hasn't been too challenging, but I see something that could be challenging coming up in my near furture. For now, I just wanted to get 
something that looked similar to Tetris. I have added a board, and pieces that will randomly spawn, no real functionality yet. The board is set up with a 
20x10 grid, but I plan to add 4 more rows at the top to give the pieces a scrolling in effect instead of just spawning in. The pieces take a little less
than a half of a second to fall to the bottom and for now the game ends. I have not done anything with disjoint sets yet (as part of the proposed plan , but 
the plan is to have them join a set by row, which will hopefully help with a score multiplier. I met with my partner and he is adding functonality for the 
keys we plan to use.

MTG's Personal Log:
	02hr generating project proposal file (50% in lab)
	02hr familiarization with ncurses
	01hr Generating potential header files, supporting files, and main
	01hr Generating MTG's Update1.txt file
	01hr Adding a file to hold all the defined pieces
	03hr Adding a board that shows a piece falling and end game (parital Tetris functionality) (also kinda temp)
	02hr figuring out the best way to get my defined pieces to translate well with the Tetris board(might need alterations)
