Project intent: 
	The intent of the following project is to create a console based game
that is inspired from a classical style arcade game. The game in question is
tetris, mainly due to its blocking and scoring methods that will be suitible
for the requirements of this project.

MTG's To do:
	-Research Tetris Mechanics ~1hr
	-Get acquainted with the library nCurses ~3hrs
	-Game Flow design ~4hrs 
	-Rubric generation ~1hr 
	-Ceate milestones doc ~1hr
	-Setup Repository ~2hrs 
	-Generate psuedo code for the separate files ~1hr
	-split header file function definitions and main between partners
	-create the game ~15hr 
	-test the game ~1hr 
	-debug and optimize ~5hr 

MTG's Rubric: 
	12 points for time spent
	08 points for repo
	10 points for code working as intended
	10 points for documentation

MTG's Personal Log:
	02hr generating this file (50% in lab)
	02hr familiarization with ncurses
	01hr Generating potential header files, supporting files, and main

MTG's Summary:
	Challenge05 was a thought expirament used to plan and strategize the 
future of this project. The time here was used to get a basis for whether the
project can be finished in time, if it is too easy, or if its too hard. Given
the potential learning curve on ncurses, I believe this project is well suited
for the final project and will meet all the criteria. We also used this time
to get a small understanding of ncurses and how it works.
