This project has been somewhat difficult, as there have been a few bugs to iron out, but overall the project is proceeding well. In this update I worked on the Disjoint sets portion 
and cleaned up the bugs in the movement functions. I met with my partner earlier in the week to outline our responsibilities and he is working on the scoring mechanisms. We aim to be finished in a week or so.
